# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive hypothesis testing framework for three specific quantitative easing (QE) hypotheses using FRED API data. The system will integrate statistical models and machine learning approaches to empirically test complex economic relationships involving central bank reactions, confidence effects, investment impacts, and international spillovers. The framework builds upon the existing QEIR codebase to provide robust econometric analysis with publication-ready results.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Central Bank Reaction and Confidence Effects Testing

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to test whether strong central bank reactions to debt service burdens combined with negative confidence effects create a threshold beyond which QE increases long-term yields, so that I can understand the non-linear dynamics of QE effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives FRED API data THEN it SHALL extract relevant variables for central bank reaction strength (γ₁), confidence effects (λ₂), debt service burdens, and long-term yields
2. WHEN analyzing central bank reactions THEN the system SHALL implement threshold regression models to identify breakpoints where QE effects reverse
3. WHEN confidence effects are significant THEN the system SHALL quantify the magnitude of |λ₂| and its interaction with reaction strength γ₁
4. WHEN threshold analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide statistical significance tests for the identified threshold
5. IF the threshold is statistically significant THEN the system SHALL generate visualizations showing the regime-switching behavior
6. WHEN results are generated THEN the system SHALL export publication-ready tables and figures documenting the threshold effects

### Requirement 2: QE Impact on Private Investment Analysis

**User Story:** As an economist, I want to analyze how intensive QE reduces long-term private investment when market distortions dominate interest rate effects, so that I can quantify the trade-offs between monetary stimulus and investment efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes investment data THEN it SHALL distinguish between short-term and long-term private investment measures from FRED
2. WHEN QE intensity is measured THEN the system SHALL create metrics for intensive vs standard QE episodes
3. WHEN analyzing market distortions THEN the system SHALL implement models to separate interest rate effects from distortion effects (μ₂)
4. WHEN distortion effects dominate THEN the system SHALL quantify the magnitude of μ₂ relative to interest rate channels
5. WHEN investment impacts are calculated THEN the system SHALL use both statistical models (VAR, local projections) and ML models (random forests, neural networks) for robustness
6. IF distortion effects are significant THEN the system SHALL provide confidence intervals and statistical tests for the dominance condition
7. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate decomposition charts showing interest rate vs distortion contributions

### Requirement 3: International QE Effects and Currency Analysis

**User Story:** As a policy analyst, I want to test whether QE reduces foreign demand for domestic bonds leading to currency depreciation and inflationary pressures, so that I can assess the international spillover effects that may offset QE benefits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system accesses international data THEN it SHALL retrieve foreign bond holdings, exchange rates, and inflation measures from FRED
2. WHEN measuring foreign demand THEN the system SHALL track changes in foreign official and private holdings of domestic bonds
3. WHEN analyzing currency effects THEN the system SHALL implement exchange rate models linking QE announcements to depreciation
4. WHEN measuring inflationary pressures THEN the system SHALL use multiple inflation indicators (CPI, PCE, import prices) to assess offsetting effects
5. WHEN testing causality THEN the system SHALL employ Granger causality tests and instrumental variable approaches
6. IF currency depreciation is significant THEN the system SHALL quantify the magnitude of inflationary offset relative to intended QE benefits
7. WHEN spillover analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide cross-country comparison analysis
8. WHEN results are finalized THEN the system SHALL generate international transmission mechanism diagrams

### Requirement 4: FRED API Integration and Data Management

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want automated FRED API integration to retrieve all necessary economic indicators for hypothesis testing, so that I can ensure data consistency and reproducibility across analyses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL authenticate with FRED API using secure credential management
2. WHEN data is requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve time series for all required variables with proper error handling
3. WHEN data gaps exist THEN the system SHALL implement interpolation methods appropriate for economic time series
4. WHEN data is processed THEN the system SHALL align all series to consistent frequencies and date ranges
5. IF API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and retry mechanisms
6. WHEN data is cached THEN the system SHALL store retrieved data locally with timestamp validation for updates
7. WHEN data quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL flag anomalies and provide data quality reports

### Requirement 5: Statistical and Machine Learning Model Integration

**User Story:** As a quantitative researcher, I want to apply both traditional econometric methods and modern ML techniques to test the hypotheses, so that I can ensure robust findings across different methodological approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN statistical models are implemented THEN the system SHALL include threshold VAR, regime-switching models, and local projections
2. WHEN ML models are applied THEN the system SHALL implement random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks for non-linear relationship detection
3. WHEN model comparison is performed THEN the system SHALL provide cross-validation scores and out-of-sample performance metrics
4. WHEN ensemble methods are used THEN the system SHALL combine statistical and ML predictions with appropriate weighting
5. IF model assumptions are violated THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic tests and alternative specifications
6. WHEN uncertainty quantification is needed THEN the system SHALL provide bootstrap confidence intervals and prediction intervals
7. WHEN model selection is performed THEN the system SHALL use information criteria (AIC, BIC) and cross-validation for optimal specification

### Requirement 6: Publication-Ready Output Generation

**User Story:** As an academic researcher, I want to generate publication-quality results including tables, figures, and statistical summaries, so that I can directly use the outputs in research papers and policy reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate LaTeX-formatted tables with proper statistical notation
2. WHEN visualizations are created THEN the system SHALL produce high-resolution figures suitable for journal publication
3. WHEN statistical results are summarized THEN the system SHALL include all relevant test statistics, p-values, and confidence intervals
4. WHEN model diagnostics are performed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive diagnostic plots and test results
5. IF multiple specifications are tested THEN the system SHALL create robustness tables comparing results across models
6. WHEN international analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate cross-country comparison tables and spillover matrices
7. WHEN final outputs are exported THEN the system SHALL organize results in a structured directory with clear file naming conventions
