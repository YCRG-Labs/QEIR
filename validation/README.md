```bash
python validation/run_validation_suite.py
```

## Model Validation

### `hansen_model_validation.py`
Validates Hansen threshold regression implementation against established benchmarks.

### `local_projections_validation.py`
Tests local projections methodology for accuracy and robustness.

### `econometric_benchmark_validation.py`
Compares QEIR implementations against standard econometric software packages.

### `software_comparison_validation.py`
Cross-validation against R, Stata, and other econometric software.

## Performance Testing

### `performance_benchmarks.py`
Benchmarks computational performance and memory usage of core algorithms.

### `dashboard_performance_testing.py`
Tests interactive dashboard performance under various load conditions.

### `validate_performance_framework.py`
Validates the performance measurement framework itself.

## Robustness Testing

### `comprehensive_robustness_generator.py`
Generates comprehensive robustness tests across specifications and time periods.

### `generate_robustness_outputs.py`
Creates robustness testing outputs and documentation.

### `create_robustness_documentation.py`
Generates documentation for robustness testing procedures.

### `specification_test_validation.py`
Validates specification testing procedures and diagnostics.

## Enhanced Diagnostics

### `apply_enhanced_diagnostics.py`
Applies enhanced diagnostic procedures to validate model specifications.

## Publication Outputs

### `generate_publication_figures.py`
Generates and validates publication-quality figures and tables.

## Running Validation

## Validation Reports

Validation scripts generate detailed reports including:

- **Accuracy Tests**: Comparison against known results
- **Performance Metrics**: Computational efficiency measurements  
- **Robustness Checks**: Stability across specifications
- **Quality Assurance**: Publication readiness validation

## Continuous Integration

These validation scripts are designed to be run in CI/CD pipelines to ensure:

- Code changes don't break existing functionality
- Performance regressions are detected early
- Publication quality is maintained
- Cross-platform compatibility is verified

## Validation Standards

All validation follows established econometric standards:

- Monte Carlo simulation for statistical properties
- Cross-validation against peer-reviewed implementations
- Numerical accuracy within acceptable tolerances
- Performance benchmarks against industry standards
